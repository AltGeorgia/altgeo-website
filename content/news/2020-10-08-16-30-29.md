title: International Cannabis Cultivation Study
date: 2020-10-08T09:33:32.013Z
description: >-
  International Cannabis Cultivation Questionnaire (ICCQ) was launched the first
  wave of this survey back in 2012. Thanks to the contribution of over 6500
  growers around the world, researchers were able to publish more than 18
  scientific papers which have helped challenge stereotypes of cannabis growers.
  The ICCQ is designed to study patterns of small-scale cannabis cultivation.
  The ICCQ was developed by members of the Global Cannabis Cultivation Research
  Consortium (GCCRC), which is comprised of researchers from around the world
  interested in a better understanding of domestic cannabis cultivation. Georgia
  joined the wave of this survey in 2020. Georgian version of the questionnaire
  was prepared by the Addiction Research Master Program of Ilia State University
  and Addiction Research Center - Alternative Georgia
