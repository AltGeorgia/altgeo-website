  On 2nd December 2019, “The Human Rights Education and Monitoring Center (EMC)”
  conducted a training on “Current Drug Policy and Human Rights” with the
  participation of criminal lawyers. 

  The purpose of the training was to discuss the challenges of drug policy,
  raise awareness of state policy on drug crime and increase sensitivity in the
  field of drug policy.

  As part of the training, researchers from “Alternative Georgia”, Irma Kirtadze
  and David Otiashvili, presented reports on physical and mental effects of
  psychoactive substances and the state's approaches to the drug treatment and
  harm reduction.
