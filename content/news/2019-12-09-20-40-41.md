European Ibogaine Forum 2019 was held on 5, 6 and 7th of December at Ilia State University. Event is organized by activist David Subeliani, Georgia Psychedelic Society, Ilia State University Master Program of Addiction Studies and Ibogaine For The World.

 Ibogaine is the derivative of an African Rainforest plant - Tabernanthe Iboga - that can function as a potent and effective treatment for substance abuse, Parkinson's Disease, PTSD and several other neurodegenerative illnesses.

The conference brought together leading academic scientists, researchers, and practitioners to present and share their experiences and research results about all aspects of Ibogaine mediated treatments. The conference focused on evidence-based benefits proven in clinical trials, treatment centers and retreats all around the world.

The goal of the conference was to provide a scientific forum for all international prestige scholars around the world and enable the interactive exchange of state-of-the-art knowledge. It also provided the premier interdisciplinary platform for scientists, doctors, practitioners, and students to exchange ideas and support research development in this field.
