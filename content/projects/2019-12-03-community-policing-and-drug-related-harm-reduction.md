description: "The project is being implemented by the Addiction Research Center  “Alternative Georgia”. The goal of the project is to develop psychoactive substance use related knowledge and skills of community police officers and support their engagement in addressing drug related problems in communities\nIn developed countries there is a growing understanding of the benefits of community policing, which implies close collaboration between law enforcement officers and local community residents who work together as partners to prevent crime. In these cases relationship between police and communities improves, local residents’ trust towards police increases, police officers have more accurate information about criminal situation in a specific community, and have better understanding of the needs and expectations of community members. Within this model issues related to use of illegal substances constitute important part of the problems that community policing focuses on. Police can work together with communities to support prevention of drug use and abuse, but also can provide needed support to people affected by substance use (reducing risks and harms related to drug use, referring to helping services and so on). \nThe goal of the project is to develop psychoactive substance use related knowledge and skills of community police officers and support their engagement in addressing drug related problems in communities.\nSpecific objectives of the project are as follows:\n1.\tAssess Georgian regulatory framework (laws, regulations, ministerial decrees) related to community policing; assess knowledge and attitudes of community police officers in relation to substance use\n2.\tReview international experience with community policing, in particular in relation to addressing drug related issues\n3.\tBased on Objectives 1 and 2 propose changes to the regulatory framework in order to enable effective involvement of community police officers with reducing/preventing drug related crime and reducing drug related harms\n4.\tOrganize a study visit of representatives of MIA (including community police officers) to learn practical experience in drug related community policing (preliminary to one of EU countries or the US; to be determined later)\n5.\tDevelop an educational module for community police officers in order to build their knowledge and overall capacity on approaches and interventions aimed at reducing/preventing drug related crime and drug related harms."
