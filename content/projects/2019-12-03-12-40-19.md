description: >-
  Needle and syringe programs (NSP) are evidence-based intervention to prevent
  HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID). Syringe Vending Machines
  (SVM) are cost-effective intervention to supplement the standard NSP, to reach
  hard to reach groups, and to cover un-served geographical areas. The aim of
  the ongoing parent implementation trial is to evaluate the implementation
  process (and effectiveness) of SVM and to increase access to sterile injection
  equipment for PWID in Tbilisi, Georgia.


  With partnership of National Center for Disease Control and Public Health
  (NCDC) and Georgian Harm Reduction Network (GHRN), Alternative Georgia is
  implementing SVMs which work 24/7 and provide sterile injection equipment,
  condoms, Naloxone kit, contact information and educational brochures for PWID.


  The project is supported by the 5% Initiative implemented by Expertise France
  and funded by the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs and
  co-financed by The Global Fund.
