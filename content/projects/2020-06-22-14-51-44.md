  There is fragmented information coming from the field workers of harm
  reduction programs and community representatives that the COVID-19 pandemic
  started to impact on illicit drug supply and drug consumption practices. We
  hypothesize that the pandemic will affect illicit drug markets, including
  online markets, in terms of changing availability, purity, pricing for illicit
  drugs, and will facilitate changes in drug users’ behaviors in terms of
  substances consumed (amounts, combinations, route of administration) and ways
  of obtaining those substances. Georgia and Ukraine are selected for this study
  due to a number of reasons.

  In this prospective cohort study, we recruited 50 regular drug users per
  country (total n=100) who fill in online questionnaire in every two weeks and
  have qualitative individual interviews once in 3 months. We will follow them
  up regularly for 24 weeks (about six months). In addition, individual
  interviews are conducted with field-experts and stakeholders once a month.
  Furthermore, we are monitoring online drug market.
