description: >-
  Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST) is effective intervention for people who
  inject drugs (PWID). While access to OST is increasing in civil sector, it
  still remains limited in Georgian penitentiary system. Georgian prisons
  provide OST to PWID for 3-5 months with the final goal of detoxification.
  Project aims to examine barriers and challenges faced by PWID in Georgian
  prisons through the investigation of experiences shared by former
  beneficiaries involved in penitentiary systemâ€™s OST and experts working in the
  field. Additionally, project team will analyze Georgian regulatory framework,
  international standards and recommendations in order to increase access to OST
  in penitentiary system. Seven-month project is funded by Center for Training
  and Consultation (CTC).
