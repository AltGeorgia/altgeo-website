title: "Smart Syringe Vending Machines: Research Capabilities and Implications
  for Research Data Collection"
publishDate: 2021-11-21T18:07:54.148Z
description: Syringe vending machines (SVMs) are intended to supplement the
  standard syringe exchange programs to access hard-to-reach groups and cover
  unserved geographical areas. This report describes how we adapted SVMs to
  deliver interventions and collect research data as part of a study of smart
  SVMs (SSVMs) in Tbilisi, Georgia.
