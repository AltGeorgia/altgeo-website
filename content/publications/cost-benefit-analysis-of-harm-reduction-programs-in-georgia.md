title: Cost-Benefit Analysis of Harm Reduction Programs in Georgia
publishDate: 2015-10-12T13:08:00.000Z
description: >-
  Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST), Needle-Syringe Programs (NSP),
  Antiretroviral

  Treatment (ART) and HIV Counseling & Testing (HCT) are key harm reduction
  interventions for

  people who inject drugs (PWID). Despite this recognition, these interventions
  are not adequately

  scaled up in Georgia. The objective of this paper is to provide a broader base
  from which to understand

  the costs of HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) prevention programs for PWIDs such as
  NSP and OST and

  the potential cost savings as a result of their implementation.
